# Fett.lol Mod

This mod adds a number of minor tweaks that were desired on the `fett.lol` Minecraft server. Some of these are inspired by other mods, where we just wanted a small portion of what that mod did and did not want to install the entire mod. Others are completely novel and are of our own creation. Another couple are recreations of mods that have been lost to the sands of time as Minecraft continued to be updated while the mod was not.

## The List of Implemented Tweaks

- (Work in Progress) A new biome named "The Fettlands" with a number of new challenges and opportunities.
- Two new swords, "Knightfall" and "Peacekeeper" exist, with drops in various Nether and End locations, respectively.
- A new "Egg Collector" enchant for weapons gives a 3% chance for mobs to drop their spawn eggs when killed.
- Villagers will follow players carrying an Emerald Block.
- Mob Spawners can be disabled by powering them with Redstone.

- A "Aquamarine Gem" exists that is used for a number of recipes related to mod integrations.

- Wither Skeletons have a 10% chance to spawn as Baby Wither Skeletons.
- Witches will actively try to run away from players and maintain ranged distance.

## The List of Implemented Mod Integrations.
