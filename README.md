# Fett.lol Mod

This mod adds a number of minor tweaks that were desired on the `fett.lol` Minecraft server. Some of these are inspired
by other mods, where I just wanted a small portion of what that mod did and did not want to install the entire mod.
Others are completely novel and are of my own creation. Another couple are recreations of mods that have been lost to
the sands of time as Minecraft continued to be updated while the mod did not.

## The List of Implemented Tweaks

- Amethyst Clusters now drop XP when mined without Silk Touch.
- Two new swords, "Knightfall" and "Peacekeeper" exist, with drops in various Nether and End locations, respectively.
  - "Knightfall" is of Netherite quality. It hits a little harder, but it's also slightly slower.
  - "Peacekeeper" is of Diamond quality. It doesn't hit as hard as Diamond Swords, but it's faster.
- A new "Egg Collector" enchant for weapons gives a 3% chance for mobs to drop their spawn eggs when killed.
  - This can be used together with our craftable Spawner blocks to create custom mob farms.
- Villagers will follow players carrying an Emerald Block. Take note, however, that they are easilly distracted and
  **will** flee if mobs scare them while following you.
- When enchanted with *Infinity*, bows no longer require you to have an arrow in your inventory to fire.
- Guardians have a (small) chance to spawn in all oceans, not just around Ocean Monuments.
- The *Infinity* and *Mending* enchantments can coexist on bows.
- There's a new item called "Soul Shard", nine of which combine to make a "Soul Gem". These are used in some high-end recipes.
  - Soul Shards can be found when mining Diamond Ore (without Silk Touch), in various chests and have a small chance
    to drop from Phantoms and Endermen.
- A "Jade Gem" exists that is used for a number of recipes related to mod integrations.
  - It can be found in various chests, fishing, and when killing magic users (Evokers and Witches).
- A "Aquamarine Gem" exists that is used for a number of recipes related to mod integrations.
  - It can be found in various chests, fishing, killing hostile aquatic mobs and mining Lapis Lazuli Ore.
- All recipes are automatically unlocked from the beginning.
  - Code exists to exclude specific recipes from this list, which will be used for future "gating" of recipes.
- Multiple changes to various chest and mob loot tables, mainly to balance things out and include things from other
  mods so that the world feels more uniform and consistent.
- Poisoned Potatoes can be composted.
- Lily Pads no longer block the way in water and won't break when hit by a boat.
- Mob Spawners have a recipe which includes, amongst other things, a Soul Gem, a Nether Star and a Totem of Undying.
- Large collection of Player Heads for sale at a new type of Wandering Trader called "Wandering Headhunter".
- A "Withered Bone" can drop from Wither skeletons. It can be used to create Light Grey Dye or a Wither Skeleton Skull.
- Wither Skeletons have a 10% chance to spawn as Baby Wither Skeletons.
- Witches will actively try to run away from players and maintain ranged distance.
- The "Custom World" warning when creating singleplayer worlds is no longer displayed.
- A handful of additional "Splash Texts" have been added to the list that the game selects from on the title screen.

## The List of Implemented Mod Integrations.
