# TODO

A list of things to do at some point, in no particular order other than just the order I thought of them.

- Move the `winged:wingbench` fix from the `fettlol-datapack` into the mod.
- Rewrite all the spawner logic and make the `spawner_key` required to pick up spawners, even world-gen spawners.
  - Once this is in place, much of the other custom spawner logic in `utilmod` can be removed.
- Netherite TreeAxe should be a Netherite Ingot upgrade from Diamond TreeAxe and the normal recipe removed.
